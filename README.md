## Overview

iTourTT manages the complete lifecycle of transport operations: from booking traffic jobs and dispatching vehicles, to invoicing agents and exporting Odoo-ready accounting data. The system supports multiple user roles, real-time dispatch, multi-currency finance, and bilingual (English/Arabic) interfaces.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| **Frontend** | Next.js 16 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui |
| **Backend** | NestJS, TypeScript, REST APIs, JWT + Refresh Tokens |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL 16, Prisma ORM, UUID primary keys |
| **Infrastructure** | k3s (Kubernetes), Docker, cert-manager + Let's Encrypt SSL |
| **Timezone** | Africa/Cairo |

## Key Features

### Dispatch Console
- Daily view with ARR (arrival) jobs on the left, DEP (departure) on the right
- Excel-like inline editing grid with keyboard navigation
- Real-time conflict validation (capacity, double-booking)
- **Split assignment logic**: dispatchers assign vehicle + driver independently; online operators assign rep independently — neither side needs to wait for the other
- **Vehicle Fleet Overview**: visual card strip per vehicle showing all day's assignments with automatic conflict detection (🔴 confirmed time overlap within 2h, 🟡 missing time data)
- **Rep Overview**: same visual cards grouped by rep — visible to online operators
- 48-hour dispatcher time-lock with manual unlock per job
- Excel export

### Traffic Jobs
- B2B (agent) and Online (direct) booking management
- Service types: ARR, DEP, CITY, ROUND_TRIP, EXCURSION, and more
- Auto-generated internal booking references (ITT-XXXX)
- Pax count validated against vehicle capacity
- Collection amount support (multi-currency)

### Finance & Invoicing
- Multi-currency support with exchange rates stored per transaction
- Egyptian tax compliance
- Invoice lifecycle: Draft -> Posted (immutable) -> Paid
- Odoo ERP-compatible Excel exports (res.partner, account.move, account.payment, account.tax)

### Location Hierarchy
- Country -> Airport -> City -> Zone -> Hotel
- Zones as the fundamental pricing unit
- All route pricing is zone-to-zone
- **Google Maps verified coordinates** on all locations (lat/lng/placeId)
- Google Places autocomplete for location creation and editing
- Batch geocode tool for resolving existing locations without coordinates
- Full CRUD: create, edit (rename, update coordinates), and soft-delete
- Pre-seeded with 7 Egyptian airports, 12 cities, 32 zones, 107 hotels

### Geofencing
- **500m radius geofence enforcement** on driver and rep portal status changes
- Drivers must be within 500m of the airport (ARR) or hotel/zone (DEP/CITY) to complete/cancel/no-show
- Reps must be within 500m of the airport to submit status updates
- Clear error messages when outside geofence or when location coordinates are missing
- Haversine distance calculation for accurate GPS proximity checks

### Fleet Management
- Vehicle types with seat capacity enforcement
- Compliance document tracking with expiry alerts
- Driver and rep management with portal access

### Agent Management
- Full legal profile with document storage
- Credit limits and credit days
- Customizable price lists per agent (zone-to-zone, per vehicle type)
- Configurable invoice cycles

### Supplier Portal
- External transport providers with their own vehicles, drivers, and price lists
- Self-service portal for supplier resource management

### No-Show Evidence
- Submitted by driver or rep via their portal
- Up to 10 geo-tagged photos per submission
- Clickable badge on traffic jobs table opens evidence modal
- Submitter label shows `ROLE-UserName`

### Permissions & Security
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with granular permission tree
- 13 system roles: Admin, Dispatcher, Accountant, Agent Manager, Viewer, Rep, Driver, Online Operator, Dispatch Operator, Online Manager, Dispatch Manager, FC, Transportation Accountant
- **Permission-based dispatch**: Online Operators can only assign reps; Dispatch Operators can only assign vehicles/drivers — enforced at both API and UI level
- Permission-based UI rendering (sidebar, pages, actions, columns)
- JWT authentication with refresh token rotation

### Activity Log
- Automatic audit trail for all create/update/delete actions
- Filterable by user, action type, entity, and date range
- Detailed request data captured per action
- Excel export for compliance and auditing

### Portals
- **Driver Portal** - View assignments, update trip status with GPS tracking
- **Rep Portal** - Track assignments, update status with live GPS location
- **Supplier Portal** - Manage vehicles, drivers, and pricing

### Reports & Exports
- Operational and financial reporting
- Configurable date ranges and filters
- Excel export across all modules
- Odoo-ready accounting export format

### Driver & Rep Detail Pages
- Full profile page per driver: Profile, Vehicles (assign/unassign + primary), Trip Fees (date-filtered history), Account (portal login / password reset)
- Full profile page per rep: Profile, Zones (assign/unassign coverage areas), Fees (date-filtered history), Account
- Trip fee and rep fee history endpoints with date-range filtering and total summaries

### WhatsApp Notifications (3-Template System)
- Three independent message templates, each with its own trigger:
  - **Booking Confirmation** — fires immediately when a traffic job is created
  - **Driver Assigned** — fires when a driver is assigned in the Dispatch Console
  - **Day-Before Reminder** — fires on a configurable schedule (days before + hour + minute, Cairo time)
- Each template independently enabled/disabled with body editor, variable chips, and live preview
- Per-minute cron ensures minute-accurate scheduled delivery
- Deduplication: same template never sent twice to same phone for same job
- Shared media attachment (image/PDF) sent with every message

### Odoo ERP Exports
- Five one-click Excel exports directly importable into Odoo with no customization:
  - Partners (res.partner) — agents and suppliers
  - Customer Invoices (account.move)
  - Vendor Bills (account.move)
  - Payments (account.payment)
  - All-in-One combined export
- External ID system (`itour_agent_<id>`, `itour_inv_<id>`) for idempotent re-imports
- Optional date-range filtering for invoice/payment exports

### Invoice Scheduler
- Automatic draft invoice generation per agent based on their configured invoice cycle
- Supports WEEKLY (day of week), BIWEEKLY (every even ISO week), MONTHLY (day of month)
- Runs daily at 01:00 Cairo time

### Password Reset
